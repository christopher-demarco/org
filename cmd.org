* Org and my phone
** Gosh, wouldn't it be interesting to export org to the cloud?
*** Whenever I update
**** dropbox
***** - yet another third-party; tricky authnz
***** + automagic update
**** git push?
***** + travis
***** - manual
**** an org trigger?
***** + inside codebase
***** - grotty
***** see e.g. https://github.com/fniessen/orgmk
**** a local cronjob
***** - outside of codebase
***** + simple to implement
*** the agenda is exported
**** a lambda function notices the s3 bucket and renders it
**** a lambda function via api gateway
**** travis simply renders to s3
*** with responsive css
**** See https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes
**** or worst case, this is merely plaintext--it's better than nothing
*** referenced by a route53 record
** What I need on the phone is read-only
** Capture should be easy
*** just get it into an inbox
*** and perhaps the html export could generate an "change X to DONE" item

* The secret sauce isn't input, output, or processing, it's focus
** The problem with the ever-growing-list-of-doom is that it's ever-growing
** None of this shit would be a problem if I had my priorities in order
*** (which is exactly what David Allen stresses)
** I can let go of things, if I know they'll be there for me
*** Imagine that the SOMEDAY-MAYBE is actually an index of diary entries
**** Why does everything come back to writing?!
**** And why can I never get myself to write?!?!?!
** This seems to imply that the critical part of the Weekly Review is DISPOSITION
*** Say "No" to as much as possible
**** Or find a fulcrum to get it done without effort
***** Outsource Your World
